#+TITLE: Improved MHA

This repository contains an in improved implementation of the MHA algorithm by [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09567][Monti and Hyv√§rinen (2018)]] which was used for brain age prediction in [[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0232296][Monti et al. (2020)]].

There is a silent [[file:mha/legacy.py::"""# BUG: this function changes the value of its input!!!!!][bug]] in the original implementation, which has been fixed in the current implementation. Because of this, the output of the improved implementation differs from the original's.
